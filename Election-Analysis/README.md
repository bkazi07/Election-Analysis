##How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
Using the election data and Python programming, we were able to conclude that there were 369,711 votes cast in this congressional election. 

## Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
After running the code, it could be concluded that Jefferson county had a total of 38,855 votes making up 10.5%, Denver county had a total of 306,055 votes making up 82.8%, and lastly was Arapahoe county which had 24,801 votes that made up 6.7%. 

##Which county had the largest number of votes?
The county with the largest turnout was Denver county with 306,055 votes. This made up a majority of the percentage with 82.8%. 

##Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
After running the code, it could be concluded that Charles Casper Stockham had a total of 85,213 votes making up 23%, Diana DeGette had a total of 272,892 votes that made up 73.8%, and last was Raymon Anthony Doane with 11,606 votes that made up 3.1%.

##Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
The results of running the code pointed towards Diana DeGette as the winner with a winning vote count of 272,892 and a winning percentage of 73.8%

##Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
This script could be easily changed to display states instead of counties. This code was written for a smaller scale election. There can be modifications made to make it on a bigger scale. This is just counties within a state. There can be more levels added such as states in a country and cities within a state. This would help get a better grasp on election data as a whole. The percentage of democrats and republicans can be found out if a simple code is written as well. There can be a lot more data that could be found out through implementing new code.
